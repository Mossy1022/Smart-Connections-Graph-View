Our goal is to enhance your ability to discover relationships and insights within your notes, transforming the way you interact with and understand your information.

## Features

- **Dynamic Force-Directed Graph:** Visualize connections as a force-directed graph where nodes represent notes or specific excerpts from them and edges represent connections.
- **Adjustable Visualization Settings:** Customize node size, link thickness, and text fade thresholds to tailor the visualization to your preferences.
- **Interactive Tooltips:** Hover over links to see detailed information about connections.
- **Customizable Forces:** Adjust the repel force, link force, and center force for a more personalized layout.
- **Selection Box:** Multi-select nodes using a selection box, with accurate selection regardless of zoom and pan levels.

## About Me

Hi! Name's Evan Moscoso, and right now I'm a senior software developer/architect consultant for General Dynamics, contracted out to the CDC to manage and develop data visualization tools.  I've been obsessed about what's transpiring with AI for the last 15 years, knowing that it would soon change the world like this.  The text communication format between us and AI is **incredibly** inefficient, and I believe data visualization tools like this will not only exponentially enhance our ability to communicate with AI, but create a new discovery and decision making process that'll change how we go about virtually everything we do.  Our brains can't physically retain all the information and use logic with it.  We need to visualize in order to save state and keep progressing in complex problems.  I can hear the music.. and I want nothing more to improve how we communicate and make better decisions.  

Inspired by Brian (creator of Smart Connections), I started an AI consulting company "Evan's Oasis" where I audit business workflows of clients and suggest AI tools and practices to significantly increase decision making, productivity, and qualityâ€“ all while cutting down on time and money needed to run a business.  

I've continuosly been giving webinars to both CDC and GDIT on the most significant AI updates, as well as in-person local community seminars around the Tampa Bay area. 
One of my life's main questlines is to inspire people to take advantage of the outragous new abilities we have with AI and how we can use them to help us in our every day lives.

I'd really like to go all in on my AI consulting company and continue development on this when I can afford to :)
